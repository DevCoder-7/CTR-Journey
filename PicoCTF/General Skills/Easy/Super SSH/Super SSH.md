# Super SSH

Author: Jeffery John

Description:
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. 
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 54059 to get the flag? You'll also need the password 6dd28e9b. 
If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes. If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org 
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell

flag: `picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_5d09a462}`
