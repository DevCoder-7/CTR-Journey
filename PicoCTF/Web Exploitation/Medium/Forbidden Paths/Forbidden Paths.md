# Forbidden Paths

Author: LT 'syreal' Jones

Description:

Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` 
but the website is filtering absolute file paths. 
Can you get past the filter to read the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54618/).

## Solve
flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`
